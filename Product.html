        <div class="section" id ="cloud7"><strong>What are cloud services?</strong></div>
      	<div class="section" id ="cloud1">
      	</br>
      	The first sense of cloud services covers a wide range of resources that a service provider delivers to customers via the internet, 
      	</br>
      	which, in this context, has broadly become known as the cloud.
      	</br>
      	Characteristics of cloud services include self-provisioning and elasticity; that is, 
      	</br>
      	customers can provision services on an on-demand basis and shut them down when no longer necessary. 
      	</br>
      	In addition, customers typically subscribe to cloud services, under a monthly billing arrangement, for example, 
      	</br>
      	rather than pay for software licenses and supporting server and network infrastructure upfront.
      	</br>
      	In many transactions, this approach makes a cloud-based technology an operational expense, rather than a capital expense. 
      	</br>
      	From a management standpoint, cloud-based technology lets organizations access software, storage, 
      	</br>
      	compute and other IT infrastructure elements without the burden of maintaining and upgrading them.
      	</div>
      	
      	
      	
      	
      	
     	<div class="section" id ="cloud2"><strong>Why I like cloud services</strong></div>
     	
     	
    	<div class="section" id ="cloud3"><strong>1. Flexibility</strong>
    	</br>
Cloud-based services are ideal for businesses with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands.
</br>
If your needs increase it’s easy to scale up your cloud capacity, drawing on the service’s remote servers.
</br>
Likewise, if you need to scale down again, the flexibility is baked into the service.
</br>
This level of agility can give businesses using cloud computing a real advantage over competitors, 
</br>
it’s not surprising that CIOs and IT Directors rank ‘operational agility’ as a top driver for cloud adoption.
</br>
</br>
</br>
<strong>2. Disaster recovery</strong>
</br>
Businesses of all sizes should be investing in robust disaster recovery, but for smaller businesses that lack the required cash and expertise,
</br>
this is often more an ideal than the reality. Cloud is now helping more organisations buck that trend.
</br>
According to Aberdeen Group, small businesses are twice as likely as larger companies to have implemented cloud-based backup and recovery solutions that save time,
</br>
avoid large up-front investment and roll up third-party expertise as part of the deal.</div>

    	    </br>
    	    </br>
    	    <strong>4. Capital-expenditure Free</strong>
    	</br>
Cloud computing cuts out the high cost of hardware. You simply pay as you go and enjoy a subscription-based model that’s kind to your cash flow.
</br>
Add to that the ease of setup and management and suddenly your scary, hairy IT project looks at lot friendlier.
</br>
It’s never been easier to take the first step to cloud adoption.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<strong>5. Increased collaboration</strong>
</br>
When your teams can access, edit and share documents anytime, from anywhere, they’re able to do more together, and do it better. 
</br>
Cloud-based workflow and file sharing apps help them make updates in real time and gives them full visibility of their collaborations.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

<strong>6. Work from anywhere</strong>
</br>
With cloud computing, if you’ve got an internet connection you can be at work. And with most serious cloud services offering mobile apps,
</br>
you’re not restricted by which device you’ve got to hand.
