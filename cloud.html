      	</br>
      	Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools,
      	</br>
      	usually those needed for application development, to users over the internet.
      	</br>
      	A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure.
      	</br>
      	As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application. 
      	</br>
      	PaaS does not typically replace a business's entire IT infrastructure. Instead, a business relies on PaaS providers for key services,
      	</br>
      	such as application hosting or Java development. A PaaS provider builds and supplies a resilient and optimized environment on which users can install applications and data sets.
      	</br>
      	Users can focus on creating and running applications rather than constructing and maintaining the underlying infrastructure and services.

     	<div class="section" id ="Gmail"><strong>What is Caas?
     	    </br>
     	    Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor.
     	    </br>
     	    Such communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices.
     	    </br>
     	    CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service (SaaS).
     	    </br>
     	    The CaaS vendor is responsible for all hardware and software management and offers guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). 
     	    </br>
     	    CaaS allows businesses to selectively deploy communications devices and modes on a pay-as-you-go, as-needed basis. 
     	    </br>
     	    This approach eliminates the large capital investment and ongoing overhead for a system whose capacity may often exceed or fall short of current demand.</strong>

    	<div class="section" id ="Amazon"><strong> What is IaaS?
    	</br>
    	Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
    	</br>
    	IaaS is one of the three main categories of cloud computing services, alongside software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).
    	</br>
    	In an IaaS model, a cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center, 
    	</br>
    	including servers, storage and networking hardware, as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.
    	</br>
    	The IaaS provider also supplies a range of services to accompany those infrastructure components. 
    	</br>
    	These can include detailed billing, monitoring, log access, security, load balancing and clustering, as well as storage resiliency, such as backup, replication and recovery. 
    	</br>
    	These services are increasingly policy-driven, enabling IaaS users to implement greater levels of automation and orchestration for important infrastructure tasks. 
    	</br>
    	For example, a user can implement policies to drive load balancing to maintain application availability and performance.

    		        <strong> What is SaaS?
    		        </br>
Software as a service is a way of delivering centrally hosted applications over the Internet—as a service. 
</br>
SaaS applications are sometimes called web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS provider’s servers.
</br>
Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. 
</br>
The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance. 
</br>
SaaS business applications are usually accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.</strong>
